## Residential Property Value
Average tax value of single-family dwellings, condominiums and townhomes for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
The average value of a residence depends on a number of factors, including the size and age of the home as well as the perceived desirability of the neighborhood.  A high or low value isn't necessarily good or bad.   However, since homes are the major source of most family's wealth, it is important that all residents share in the economic prosperity of the community. According to the Zillow Home Value Index the average value for North Carolina in December 2010 was $135,000.

### About the Data
The total assessed value for single -family dwellings, condominiums, and townhomes summed and divided by the number of single-family dwellings, condominiums and townhouses for each Neighborhood Profile Area. Pearson's Appraisal Service identified that some neighborhoods needed to be reassessed. Based on these findings, the County will reassess the value of property in complex areas, particularly pre-1980 heterogeneous neighborhoods, to ensure equity which may change the values represented in this variable.
