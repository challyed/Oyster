## Number of Pre-School Programs
Number of licensed pre-school programs for ages 0-5 including Center Based and Family Care for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Tracking the number and location of pre-school programs allows residents to identify child care providers in their neighborhoods. The data is also useful for education providers. A low number of programs may assist in determining where and how to implement services based on related variables such as population age, population density, and household income data.  The location of programs in adjacent Neighborhood Profile Areas (NPA) should also be considered to determine the level of service.

### About the Data
Number of licensed child care programs for ages 0‚Äê5 including Center Based and Family Care for each NPA. Center Based child care facilities provide care for three or more children. The number of children in care is based on the size of individual classrooms and having sufficient staff, equipment and materials. Family Care child care facilities are provided in the providers' residence and are able to accommodate three to five children at one time.
