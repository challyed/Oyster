## Medicaid Population
Percentage of individuals that receive Medicaid for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Medicaid provides health coverage for low-income individuals and families.  High or increasing numbers of Medicaid recipients may be connected to other issues such as access to healthcare providers and usually reflects high unemployment or policy changes which expand eligibility. According to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, a total of 1,726,412 individuals were eligible for Medicaid in 2008, approximately 19% of the state's population.

### About the Data
The total population receiving Medicaid in a Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) divided the total population of the NPA. Areas with less than 5 Medicaid recipients are represented as N/A.
