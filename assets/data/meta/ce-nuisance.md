## Nuisance Complaints
Number of calls for nuisances for each Voting Precinct.

### Why is this important?
According to the Lexington Code of Ordinances, "Nuisance shall mean any condition or use of premises or of building exteriors which is detrimental to the property of others or which causes or tends to cause substantial diminution in the value of other property in the neighborhood in which such premises are located." The nuisance code exists to maintain a high quality physical environment, which is directly related to the perceptions of safety and desirability of a particular area. A high number of nuisance calls can mean a high level of discomfort in a particular area.
