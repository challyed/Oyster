## Vacancy Rate
The rate of vacancies of all residential dwelling units for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Vacant units are an occurrence in all areas.  Long standing and concentrated amounts of vacant properties could indicate financial stress on the owner, less than standard housing conditions, housing design or an oversupply of housing.

### About the Data
The number of all housing units vacant for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) divided by the number of housing units for each NPA.
