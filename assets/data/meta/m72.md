## Street Connectivity Index
Ratio of links to nodes within the street network for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Internal and external street connectivity provides public access within a development and between adjoining developments. Connectivity facilitates vehicular, bicycle and pedestrian transportation options.

### About the Data
Defined as the Total Number of Street Links (roadways or pathways) divided by the Number of Nodes (cul-de-sac or endpoint). Data for the towns will be included in the future.
