## Adults without High School Diploma
Percentage adults without a high school diploma for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Adult educational attainment is closely correlated with economic opportunity and financial stability.  Knowing the location of adults without high school diplomas can help direct education and training resources to areas of need. According to American Community Survey, the nation's unemployment rate for adults without a high school diploma was 14.9%, with a high school diploma it decreases to 9.4%, and with a Bachelor's Degree decreases to 4.9%.

### About the Data
The number of people 25 or older with less than a high school diploma for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) divided by the number of people 25 or older for each NPA.  N/A includes only NPA's with zero people 25 and older.
