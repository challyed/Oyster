## Median Age of Residents
Median age of residents for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
The median age of residents in a Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) provides an indication of its character, including the resources and the services it may need. For example, an NPA with aging residents may need services or housing to help residents age in place.  In contrast, a younger population could need help with educational or employment resources. According to the U.S. 2010 census the median age in North Carolina is 37.4.

### About the Data
The median age of residents for each NPA using Block Group geography. Census block groups are the second smallest unit of measure used in the decennial Census. Only the census block is smaller. A block group is a cluster of census blocks within the same census tract. The average block group contains 39 blocks comprising between 600 and 3,000 people, with an optimum size of 1,500 people.
