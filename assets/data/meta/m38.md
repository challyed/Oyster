## CMS Students with 10 or more Unexcused Absences
Percentage of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) students with 10 or more unexcused absences for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
A high number of unexcused absences not only reduces the likelihood a child will perform adequately, it could also lead to other negative behaviors such as juvenile crime, dropping out of school, and decreasing their ability to find a job or seek higher education. By identifying neighborhoods with high numbers of students with unexcused absences, education administrators, policy-makers, and community stakeholders may be able to develop strategies for keeping students engaged and in school.

### About the Data
The total number of Charlotte-Mecklenburg School (CMS) students with 10 or more unexcused absences divided by the total number of students. NPAs with less than 5 students were coded as N/A. NPAs do not match and cover one or more school boundary. Data represented in this variable are based on students living within the NPA regardless of which school they attend.
