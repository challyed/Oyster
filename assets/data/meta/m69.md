## Daily Transit Boardings
The average number of weekday public transit boardings including transfers for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA). Includes bus and light-rail users.

### Why is this important?
Determines a baseline for evaluating the number of transit boardings for weekday trips. This baseline can be used to determine whether ridership is increasing or decreasing over time.

### About the Data
Derived by averaging the total number of weekday boardings occurring at all stops within the NPA over the course of the current year divided by the number of weekdays in a year.
