## Building Permits
Number of building permits for each Voting Precinct.

### Why is this important?
Building permits are typically the most accurate available indicator of construction in a community, a metric that indicates both availability of developable land and economic trends related to market conditions. Building permits show areas where communities are growing and changing.

### About the Data
