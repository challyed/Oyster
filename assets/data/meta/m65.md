## Neighborhood Nuisance Violations
Number of calls for nuisances for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
The City of Charlotte's Health and Sanitation Ordinance requires property owners to maintain their premises in a safe and sanitary condition.  Violations include high weeds/grass, accumulation of trash or junk, and junk automobiles. Tracking the types of calls assists neighborhood residents identify repeated problems and develop a strategy to identify solutions.  Sudden increases in nuisance calls for service may also show signs of improvement in a community through focused enforcement efforts.
