## Births to Adolescents
Percentage of births to females under age 19 for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
While Births to Adolescents is a different measure than teen pregnancy, research shows that teenage pregnancy is associated with increased risk of poor social, economic and health outcomes for both mother and child. High rates of births to adolescents may influence trends in education variables and reflect accessibility issues with health education and health providers as well as a number of other socioeconomic factors. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, North Carolina was ranked 34 out of 51 states and the District of Columbia on 2010 preliminary teen birth rates among females aged 15-19 (with 1 representing the lowest rate and 51 representing the highest rate). On a similar scale, North Carolina was ranked 37 out of 51 states and the District of Columbia in pregnancies to females aged 15-19 in 2005.

### About the Data
Number of births to females under the age of 19 in 2009 and 2010 divided by all births in 2009 and 2010 for each Neighborhood Profile Areas (NPA). NPAs with less than 5 births are shown as N/A.
