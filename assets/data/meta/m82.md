## Residential Natural Gas Consumption
Average household monthly natural gas consumption in therms per Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Provides baseline information to determine the average natural gas use for households within the NPA.  Data can been used to target educational programs, weatherization services, grant funds or other initiatives to reduce natural gas use in areas that exhibit higher usage.  Reducing natural gas use saves money and decreases the need for additional wells and pipelines which may contribute to degradation of resources.

### About the Data
Data was received at the block group level and aggregated to the NPA geography.  Data is not included for cases where the block group contains fewer than five (5) residential customers.  Data represents the average monthly energy use in Therms for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2010 and ending June 30, 2011.
