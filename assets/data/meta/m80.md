## Adopt-a-Stream Participation
Percentage of eligible streams that are maintained by Adopt-a-Stream Program for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Provides baseline information regarding  neighborhood interest & willingness to participate in programs with positive environmental impacts.   Identifies neighborhoods where increased program education may be needed.

### About the Data
The length of stream banks maintained by the adopt-a-stream program divided by the total length of stream banks in each NPA. Does not include shoreline along the Catawba river.  For areas where a stream forms the NPA boundary, the linear feet of adopted area will be equally attributed to both NPA's.
