## Year Single-Family Housing Constructed
Average year built of single family housing for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Categorizing the average year of construction for single-family housing provides an indication of the condition of a neighborhood's housing stock.  Typically, older houses need some level of repair, renovation, or maintenance.Comparing the average year of construction with other variables such as housing code violations provides an indication of areas in need of home improvement resources.

### About the Data
The year of construction for each single-family detached housing in each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) is summed and dived by the number of housing units in the NPA. N/A includes NPAs with zero residential buildings.
