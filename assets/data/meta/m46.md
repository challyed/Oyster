## Age of Death
The average age of death for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Knowing the average age of death is valuable in understanding the health of neighborhood residents.  A low average may be caused by a variety of reasons, including poor health behaviors (low physical activity, poor nutrition, tobacco and alcohol use, and high risk activities), lack of access to health care providers, environmental issues, traffic safety conditions, violent crime, and mental health problems. According to the Center for Disease Control more than 9,000 children died from injuries in the US in 2009. Car crashes, suffocation, drowning, poisoning, fires, and falls are some of the most common ways children are hurt or killed.

### About the Data
Summing the age of death for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) divided by the total number of deaths for the NPA.
