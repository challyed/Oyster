## Fire Calls for Service Rate
Fire calls for service rate for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Knowing where high levels of service are requested for fire related calls can help Fire departments and resident know where fire safety problems exist.  Education on kitchen fires, alarm installations and maintenance, escape routes, and other fire prevention strategies can be better targeted to communities that have high call rates.

### About the Data
The number of fire calls for service in each NPA divided by the NPA population. Fire calls for service include, but were not limited to, structure fires, vehicle fires, and fire alarms for both residential and non-residential structures. Motor vehicle fires were included but accidents were excluded. Any calls for service where the primary reason was medic related were not included.
