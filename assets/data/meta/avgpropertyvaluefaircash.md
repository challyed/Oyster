## Residential Property Value
Average tax value of single-family dwellings, condominiums and townhomes for Voting Precinct.

### Why is this important?
Average residential property value is a good indicator of the health of individual properties themselves in a given area. High property value in an area indicates maintenance of properties in that area, but more importantly, it is a good indicator of desirability of an area.

### About the Data
The fair cash value for all properties in a voting precinct divided by the total number of properties in that precinct.
