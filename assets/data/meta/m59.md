## Residential Foreclosures
Percentage of residential foreclosures for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
The foreclosure crisis can have debilitating effects on neighborhoods.  Concentrations of foreclosed homes in an area negatively affect property values and public services. Foreclosures can be found in all neighborhoods; however, the impacts are more problematic in certain locations and within certain housing markets. There are 3,520 foreclosures represented on this map or 1.2% of single-family (attached and detached) housing units.

### About the Data
The number of foreclosures for single-family dwellings, condominiums and townhouses in each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) identified by the Sales Code of FC in Sale History divided by the number of residential units in each NPA.
