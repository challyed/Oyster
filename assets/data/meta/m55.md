## New Residential Building Permits
Number of new residential building permits for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Tracking permit data for new residential construction provides an indication of market conditions, the availability of developable land, or trends in how people choose to live (single-family vs. multi- family housing). Related variables that identify trends in the housing market include average size of single-family dwellings, median income, non-residential development, renovation permits, and change in property value.

### About the Data
The number of all “new” residential building permits for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) ) using U.S. Department of Commerce reporting data on New Buildings (Codes 100 through 105).
