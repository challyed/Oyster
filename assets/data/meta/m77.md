## Residential Solid Waste Diversion Rate
Percentage of total residential solid waste that has been diverted from landfills through recycling and yard waste collection programs for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).  

### Why is this important?
Variable creates a baseline for evaluating the success of residential waste diversion programs as a measure to reduce the amount of solid waste being deposited in landfills.

### About the Data
Calculated by adding the tonnage of residential recycled waste and residential yard waste divided by the tonnage of residential solid waste collected including tonnage of residential garbage, recycling, yard waste and non-recyclable bulky item pickup for the period between July 2011 and June 2012. Only includes data for single family residential units (attached and detached) and multi-family residences with less than 30 units and any additional legacy multi-family dwellings. Does not include information from all apartment complexes. Data for the towns, if available, will be added in the future.
