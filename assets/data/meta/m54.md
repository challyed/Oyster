## Heated Square Feet of Single-Family Detached Dwellings
Average heated square feet of single-family detached dwellings for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Calculating the average dwelling size can be useful in assessing the impact of house size on the environment.  Such impacts include household energy consumption, lot coverage, tree canopy coverage, and storm water system impacts. The data may also reveal trends of how people are choosing to live, relative to recent changes in the economy.

### About the Data
The heated square footage of all single-family detached housing summed and divided by the total number of single-family housing units.
