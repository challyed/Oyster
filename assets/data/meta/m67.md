## Commuters Driving Alone
Percentage of commuters 16 years or older who report that they commute to work by driving alone for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Transportation alternatives offer mobility options for residents of all ages and income levels and can help bridge the spatial divide between people and jobs, services, and training opportunities.

### About the Data
