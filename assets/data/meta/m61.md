## Single-Family Rental Houses (Detached)
Percentage of detached single-family rental dwellings for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Rental housing is a desirable option for many residents, particularly in the current economic climate. There is no reliable data regarding the effect of rented homes on neighborhood property value.  Increasing numbers of rented properties should be analyzed with other data such as the age and condition of the homes, design, or house size, adjacent land uses, and area incomes. A major factor to consider with rented homes is the level of management by the owners which impacts adjacent properties positively or negatively as much as owner-occupied dwellings.

### About the Data
The number of single-family (detached) rental housing summed for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) and divided by the NPA total number of single-family (detached housing).
