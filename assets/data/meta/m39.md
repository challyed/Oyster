## CMS Dropout Rate
Percentage of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) students that drop out of high school for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Dropping out of high school significantly reduces the likelihood finding steady employment with reasonable wages.  Studies have consistently shown that the higher level of educational attainment, the greater the chance of earning higher wages and staying employed. By identifying neighborhoods with high dropout rates, education administrators, policy-makers, and community stakeholders are able to develop strategies that will reduce dropout rates.

### About the Data
The total number of CMS students who withdrew (CODE W2A) from CMS divided by the total number of 9‚Äê12 grade students.  NPAs with less than 5 students were coded as N/A. NPAs do not match and cover one or more school boundary. Data represented in this variable are based on students living within the NPA regardless of which school they attend.
