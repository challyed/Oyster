## Residents within ½ Mile of Medicaid Provider or Free Clinic
Percentage of residential housing units within ½ mile of Medicaid provider or free clinic for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
This variable looks at the location of all healthcare providers including primary care, OB/GYN, internal medicine, and pediatrics and free health clinics within a neighborhood.  It does not take into account whether these providers have restrictions on persons they care for.  It is a way to analyze potential gaps in areas that may need certain types of health services.

### About the Data
The number of housing units with ½ mile of a health care provider or free clinic in a Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) divided by the total number of housing units in an NPA.
