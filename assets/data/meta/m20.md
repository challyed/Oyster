## Population Receiving Food & Nutrition Services (FNS)
Percentage of the total population receiving Food and Nutrition Services for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
The Food and Nutrition Services is established to end hunger and improve the health of low-income people by helping families buy the food they need for a nutritionally adequate diet. Identifying communities with high FNS percentages is useful for service providers and neighborhoods who want to know where families in distress are located.

### About the Data
The total population receiving Food and Nutrition Services (FNS) for a Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) divided the total population for a NPA.  Areas with less than 5 FNS recipients has been suppressed and are shown as N/A.
