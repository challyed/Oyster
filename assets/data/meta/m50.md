## Residents within ½ Mile of a Pharmacy
Percentage of residential housing units within ½ mile of a pharmacy for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Prescription drugs allow large numbers of people to control chronic disease and disability. Easy access is a major factor in compliance along with affordable cost.  Pharmacists are an 'in-the-community' resource for health information and many pharmacists now offer acute care health clinics as well.

### About the Data
The number of housing units with ½ mile of a pharmacy in a NPA divided by the total number of housing units in an NPA.
