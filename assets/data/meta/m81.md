## Residential Electricity Consumption
Average household monthly electricity consumption in kilowatts per Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Provides baseline information to determine the average electricity use for households within the NPA.  Data can been used to target educational programs, weatherization services, grant funds or other initiatives to reduce energy use in areas that exhibit higher usage.  Reducing electricity use saves money and lowers the demand for additional power plants to be constructed which may lead to increased air pollution and degradation of resources.

### About the Data
Data was received at the block group level and aggregated to the NPA geography. Data represents the average monthly energy use in kilowatt hours for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 2010 and ending June 30, 2011. Data is not included for cases where the block group contains fewer than five (5) residential customers. Data is not included for the towns as information is not finalized.
