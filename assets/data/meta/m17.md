## Median Household Income
Median household income of each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
The median household income provides an indication of how well people are doing financially in a neighborhood.Lower wage earners may have higher percentages of their income devoted to consumption and less for saving, making them less resilient in economic downturns.  Higher wage earners may have more of their income available for consumption and more savings that can enable them to be more resilient in economic downturns. Total disposable income is a function of both consumption and population. Service providers and retailers look at income levels to help them locate their services.
