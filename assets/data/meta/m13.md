## Registered Voters
Percentage of registered voters in the 2010 election for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Registering to vote is a fundamental component of community engagement. Data is not available to determine the percent of those eligible who are registered, so this number can be impacted by large immigrant, transient or youth populations in a Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### About the Data
Number of voters  registered in each NPA divided by the population (18 years of age and older) in each NPA.
