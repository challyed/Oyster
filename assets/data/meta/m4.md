## Developed Tax Parcels
Percentage of tax parcels developed by land area for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Calculating the percentage of developed land is useful when compared to the type and density of uses that exist in a neighborhood for future land use planning.

### About the Data
Tax parcel areas, regardless of size, with a  taxable structure of any kind, are summarized to the NPA geography and divided by the land area of the NPA. Infrastructure development is not included. Any tax parcels with a structure that is taxed is considered developed, regardless of zoning. Data does not represent impervious surface or metric used for environmental measures.
