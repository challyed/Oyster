## Bicycle Friendliness Index
Provides an indication of an NPA's ability to comfortably support cycling activities as determined by existing low speed local streets,  availability of bicycle specific facilities and street connectivity for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Cycling has positive transportation, environmental, economic and health benefits.  Bicycle Friendliness references a neighborhood's ability to comfortably support bicycling. 

### About the Data
Defined as (Low Speed Street Miles + Bike Lane Miles + Completed Greenways/Multiuse Path Miles) divided by (Total Street Mileage + Total Completed and Proposed Greenways/Multiuse Path Mileage) + (Connectivity Ratio).  The result is a score between 1 and 3 with 1 being least bicycle friendly and 3 being most bicycle friendly. Low speed streets are streets with a speed limit of 25mph or less. Unpaved paths without a surface intended to support most bicycles are not included. Data for the towns, if available, will be included in the future.
