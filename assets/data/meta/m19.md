## Persons Working 35 Hours or Less
Percentage of persons not working full time for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Information on unemployment is not available at the neighborhood level. Therefore, Percentage of Persons Working 35 Hours or Less a week in conjunction with Percentage of Persons Employed 6 months or Less serve as proxies to examine potential employment issues in the community. In some communities, individuals choose to work less than full-time, in others they are unable to find full-time work.  Analyzing the characteristics of our workforce through persons not working full time helps us understand a community's economy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in North Carolina declined from 11.4% in January 2010 to 10.6% in December 2010. 

### About the Data
