## Structures in Floodplain
The total number of structures that are partially or completely located with a floodplain as defined by the Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA). 

### Why is this important?
Defines the number of structures likely to experience flooding over time and can assist in prioritizing what areas may be beneficial for participation in FEMA sponsored buyout programs.

### About the Data
Does not include areas subject to flooding that are not regulated by FEMA.  N/A indicates NPA's where there were no structures within the floodplain or no floodplain within the NPA.
