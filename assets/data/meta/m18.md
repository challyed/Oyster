### Why is this important?

Therefore,the Percentage of Persons Employed 6 Month or Less in combination with Percentage of Persons Working 35 Hours or Less serve as proxies to examine potential employment issues in the community. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in North Carolina declined from 11.4% in January 2010 to 10.6% in December 2010.
