## Residential Building Permits (Renovation)
Number of renovation permits for residential buildings for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Tracking permit data of renovation projects provides an indication of market trends (new construction vs. improving an existing home), availability of developable land, or trends in how people choose to invest in housing (purchase new or improve an existing home). An increase in renovation permits could also signal broad based rehabilitation projects in older neighborhoods.

### About the Data
The number of all “renovation” residential building permits for each Neighborhood Profile Area ) using US Department of Commerce reporting data on Alterations to Buildings (Codes 434 and 438).
