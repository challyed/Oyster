## Residential Recycling Participation Rate
Percentage of eligible residences who participate in the City sponsored residential recycling program at least one time per quarter in a fiscal year for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
This information could help the city and towns develop more targeted residential recycling campaigns; lessons learned from areas of high participation can be applied to recycling promotional efforts in other areas.

### About the Data
Determined by data from sensors affixed to residential roll out bins.  Recycling participation is determined by dividing the number of residences who have participated in the residential recycling program one or more times per quarter for the period between July 2011 and June 2012 divided by the total number of eligible residences. Only includes data for single family residential units (attached and detached) and multi-family residences with less than 30 units and any additional legacy multi-family dwellings.  Does not include information from all apartment complexes. Data for the towns, if available, will be added in the future.
