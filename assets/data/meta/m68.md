## Length of Commute
The percentage of people working outside the home with travel time to work greater than or equal to 30 minutes for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Lengthy commutes contribute to increased fossil fuel consumption and congestion.  Significant use of fossil fuels increases costs and contributes to diminished air quality.

### About the Data
The number of commuters 16 years and older who report that their commute to work is 30 minutes or greater divided by the total number of commuters 16 years and older.
