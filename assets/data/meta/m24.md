## Year Commercial Buildings Constructed 
Average year of construction for commercial buildings for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Aging commercial structures may provide opportunities for rehabilitation and reuse, particularly big box retail and older commercial strip centers.  Knowing the age of buildings helps the City and County determine where to target incentives and inspections.

### About the Data
The year of construction for each commercial building is summed and divided by the total number of commercial buildings for each Neighborhood Profile Area.
