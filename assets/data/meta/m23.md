## Square Feet of Permitted New and Renovated Commercial Buildings
The total square footage of new and renovated (complete upfits) commercial buildings for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Determining the amount of new and renovated commercial space in a neighborhood is an indicator of where there is economic growth and expansion in a community. To accommodate increasing population and development in underutilized areas, an increase in commercial permits is desirable to keep up with demand.

### About the Data
The total heated square footage of permitted new and renovated Commercial Buildings for each NPA using US Department of Commerce reporting data on New and Alterations to Buildings (Codes 213,318-320,322-328). Upfits include changes based on building code, safety measures or enhancements to heating/cooling, plumbing and electrical systems. From July 2010 to June 2011, there was 8.4 million square feet of permitted new and renovated commercial space in Mecklenburg County. N/A includes NPAs with zero square feet permitted or value was unknown.
