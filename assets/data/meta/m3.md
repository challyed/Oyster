## Area (in acres)
Physical size of each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
The size of a NPA is best used as a profile variable for analysis with population, density, and land use data.

### About the Data
The size of each NPA is calculated using ArcGIS, a geographic information system for working with maps and geographic information. ArcGIS is used for: creating and using maps; compiling geographic data; analyzing mapped information; sharing and discovering geographic information; using maps and geographic information in a range of applications; and managing geographic information in a database.
