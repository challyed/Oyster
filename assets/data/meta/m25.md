## Violent Crime Rate
Violent crimes rate per 100,000 for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) in 2011.

### Why is this important?
Perhaps the most important indicator of community safety is the violent crime rate.  This data shows where high rates of violent crime exist, so that neighborhoods and public safety officials can maximize resources. By having access to additional resources, residents and police departments can develop strategies to target specific crimes.

### About the Data
The total number of violent crimes in each NPA divided by the population for each NPA.  The per person rate was converted to number of crimes per 100,000. Violent crimes are defined by the North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation and include Murder, Rape, and Aggravated Assault.
