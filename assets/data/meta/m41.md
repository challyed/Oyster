## Children Attending Private Schools

### Why is this important?
Identifying the percentage of children enrolled in private schools reflects emerging trends of how parents choose to educate their children. It also serves as a proxy for Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) administration to assess the educational needs in the community.According to the Division of Non-Public Education, 10.9% of students in North Carolina attended private schools during the 2010-2011 school year, not including home schools.
