## Housing Code Violations
Number of all housing units with code violations for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Mecklenburg County's housing code regulations are used to ensure residents are not affected by substandard residential buildings.  Structures that do not meet minimum housing code must achieve compliance through the housing code process. A high number of violations may indicate targeted areas for improvement or the presence of older buildings in need of rehabilitation.

### About the Data
Shown as an average compared to total number of dwellings in the NPA.
