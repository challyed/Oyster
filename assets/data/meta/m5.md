## Residential Housing Density
Average number of housing units per acre for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).

### Why is this important?
Calculating housing residential density provides an indication of the residential character of a neighborhood.  Lower housing unit density is typified by larger lots in a suburban development pattern while higher density neighborhoods have smaller lots.  Residential density is not directly related to house size. 

### About the Data
The number of housing units for each Neighborhood Profile Area divided by the number of land acres.
