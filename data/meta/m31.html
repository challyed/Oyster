<p>Tracking the number and location of after school programs allows residents to identify providers in their neighborhoods.  The data is also useful for education providers. A low number of programs may assist in determining where and how to implement services based on related variables such as population age, population density, and household income. The location of programs in adjacent Neighborhood Profile Areas (NPAs) should also be considered to determine the level of service.</p>
