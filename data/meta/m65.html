<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>The City of Charlotte&#39;s Health and Sanitation Ordinance requires property owners to maintain their premises in a safe and sanitary condition.  Violations include high weeds/grass, accumulation of trash or junk, and junk automobiles. Tracking the types of calls assists neighborhood residents identify repeated problems and develop a strategy to identify solutions.  Sudden increases in nuisance calls for service may also show signs of improvement in a community through focused enforcement efforts.</p>
