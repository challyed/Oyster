<p>The foreclosure crisis can have debilitating effects on neighborhoods.  Concentrations of foreclosed homes in an area negatively affect property values and public services. Foreclosures can be found in all neighborhoods; however, the impacts are more problematic in certain locations and within certain housing markets. There are 3,520 foreclosures represented on this map or 1.2% of single-family (attached and detached) housing units.</p>
