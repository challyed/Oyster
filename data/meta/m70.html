<h2 id="bicycle-friendliness-index">Bicycle Friendliness Index</h2>
<p>Provides an indication of an NPA&#39;s ability to comfortably support cycling activities as determined by existing low speed local streets,  availability of bicycle specific facilities and street connectivity for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Cycling has positive transportation, environmental, economic and health benefits.  Bicycle Friendliness references a neighborhood&#39;s ability to comfortably support bicycling. </p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>Defined as (Low Speed Street Miles + Bike Lane Miles + Completed Greenways/Multiuse Path Miles) divided by (Total Street Mileage + Total Completed and Proposed Greenways/Multiuse Path Mileage) + (Connectivity Ratio).  The result is a score between 1 and 3 with 1 being least bicycle friendly and 3 being most bicycle friendly. Low speed streets are streets with a speed limit of 25mph or less. Unpaved paths without a surface intended to support most bicycles are not included. Data for the towns, if available, will be included in the future.</p>
