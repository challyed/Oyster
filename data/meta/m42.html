<p>Access to quality schools is important to family and neighborhood health.  Neighborhoods with schools that families choose to utilize have more opportunities to build strong community partnerships, strengthening student outcomes and experiences.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>The number of CMS students attending their home school in each NPA divided by the total number of CMS students in each NPA. NPAs with less than 5 students were coded as N/A. NPAs do not match and cover one or more school boundary. Data represented in this variable are based on students living within the NPA regardless of which school they attend.</p>
