<p>Average household monthly natural gas consumption in therms per Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Provides baseline information to determine the average natural gas use for households within the NPA.  Data can been used to target educational programs, weatherization services, grant funds or other initiatives to reduce natural gas use in areas that exhibit higher usage.  Reducing natural gas use saves money and decreases the need for additional wells and pipelines which may contribute to degradation of resources.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
