<p>Percentage of all subsidized housing units for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Identifying the location of subsidized units allows housing providers to develop implementation plans and residents to understand the types of housing choices that are present in their community. Concentrating assisted-housing for low and very low-income Americans in dense, urban areas is not an effective use of scarce affordable housing resources (USHUD). Mixed-income development has become a popular housing solution by creating diverse communities and decentralizing poverty.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>The number of subsidized housing for each neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) divided by the total number of housing units for each NPA. Subsidized housing includes single-family, condominiums and townhouses and multi-family housing. Although most subsidized housing units are multi‚Äêfamily, the data and information available to distinguish between the two housing types is not reliable. The definition of subsidized housing varies depending on the municipality.</p>
