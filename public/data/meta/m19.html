<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Information on unemployment is not available at the neighborhood level. Therefore, Percentage of Persons Working 35 Hours or Less a week in conjunction with Percentage of Persons Employed 6 months or Less serve as proxies to examine potential employment issues in the community. In some communities, individuals choose to work less than full-time, in others they are unable to find full-time work.  Analyzing the characteristics of our workforce through persons not working full time helps us understand a community&#39;s economy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate in North Carolina declined from 11.4% in January 2010 to 10.6% in December 2010. </p>
