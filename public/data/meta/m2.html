<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>The median age of residents in a Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA) provides an indication of its character, including the resources and the services it may need. For example, an NPA with aging residents may need services or housing to help residents age in place.  In contrast, a younger population could need help with educational or employment resources. According to the U.S. 2010 census the median age in North Carolina is 37.4.</p>
