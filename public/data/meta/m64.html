<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Mecklenburg County&#39;s housing code regulations are used to ensure residents are not affected by substandard residential buildings.  Structures that do not meet minimum housing code must achieve compliance through the housing code process. A high number of violations may indicate targeted areas for improvement or the presence of older buildings in need of rehabilitation.</p>
