<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Quantifying housing affordability by median rental cost provides an indication of the overall value of residential property, amenities in the surrounding area or types of adjacent land uses among other related variables. Neighborhoods with rental costs below area averages do not always indicate a lower quality of living.  Other factors to consider in lower rents are the average size of housing units, location, housing design, and supply of housing in the area.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>The median gross rent of all housing units for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).   Gross rent is the contract rent plus the estimated average monthly cost of utilities (electricity, gas, and water and sewer) and fuels (oil, coal, kerosene, wood, etc.) if these are paid by the renter (or paid for the renter by someone else).N/A includes only NPAs with less than 50 rental units in the sample. Rent cost is inflation adjusted to 2010.</p>
