<p>Average tax value of single-family dwellings, condominiums and townhomes for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>The average value of a residence depends on a number of factors, including the size and age of the home as well as the perceived desirability of the neighborhood.  A high or low value isn&#39;t necessarily good or bad.   However, since homes are the major source of most family&#39;s wealth, it is important that all residents share in the economic prosperity of the community. According to the Zillow Home Value Index the average value for North Carolina in December 2010 was $135,000.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>The total assessed value for single -family dwellings, condominiums, and townhomes summed and divided by the number of single-family dwellings, condominiums and townhouses for each Neighborhood Profile Area. Pearson&#39;s Appraisal Service identified that some neighborhoods needed to be reassessed. Based on these findings, the County will reassess the value of property in complex areas, particularly pre-1980 heterogeneous neighborhoods, to ensure equity which may change the values represented in this variable.</p>
