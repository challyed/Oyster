<p>While Births to Adolescents is a different measure than teen pregnancy, research shows that teenage pregnancy is associated with increased risk of poor social, economic and health outcomes for both mother and child. High rates of births to adolescents may influence trends in education variables and reflect accessibility issues with health education and health providers as well as a number of other socioeconomic factors. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, North Carolina was ranked 34 out of 51 states and the District of Columbia on 2010 preliminary teen birth rates among females aged 15-19 (with 1 representing the lowest rate and 51 representing the highest rate). On a similar scale, North Carolina was ranked 37 out of 51 states and the District of Columbia in pregnancies to females aged 15-19 in 2005.</p>
