<p>Medicaid provides health coverage for low-income individuals and families.  High or increasing numbers of Medicaid recipients may be connected to other issues such as access to healthcare providers and usually reflects high unemployment or policy changes which expand eligibility. According to the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, a total of 1,726,412 individuals were eligible for Medicaid in 2008, approximately 19% of the state&#39;s population.</p>
