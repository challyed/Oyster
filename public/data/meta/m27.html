<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>The juvenile incident rate shows where the arrests were made.  The data does not infer that crimes in a NPA are committed by juveniles who live there. Reporting the data allows police departments, school officials, residents, community relations agencies, and area businesses to develop strategies to reduce the number of juvenile crimes.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>The total number of incidents committed resulting in an arrest of juveniles under the age of 16 divided by the juvenile population for each Neighborhood Profile Area. The rate was converted to number of crimes per 100,000.</p>
