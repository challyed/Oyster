<p>Percentage of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS) students in grades 6-8 proficient in End of Grade testing for each Neighborhood Profile Area (NPA).</p>
<h3 id="why-is-this-important-">Why is this important?</h3>
<p>Averaging test scores in a neighborhood assists education administrators, policy-makers, businesses, and residents in developing strategies to improve academic performance where needed.  Tracking the data over time also provides a trend analysis for improving education indicators.</p>
<h3 id="about-the-data">About the Data</h3>
<p>The total number of CMS 6-8 graders passing both reading and math end of grade tests divided by the total number of CMS 6-8 graders taking both reading and math end of grade tests. Not every student may have taken an EOG test. NPAs with less than 5 students were coded as N/A. NPAs do not match and cover one or more school boundary. Data represented in this variable are based on students living within the NPA regardless of which school they attend. </p>
